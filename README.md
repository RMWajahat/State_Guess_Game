# State_Guess_Game
  This game uses pandas to read and write operations with CSV format files and a turtle module for creating visuals.
If you make a guess that it is true, the program will correctly write the name to the coordinates where the state lies on the map.

**Libraries used:**
1. Pandas    pip install pandas
2. Turtle Graphics
